There are a few steps to submitting a PR:
1. Please ensure decent code quality and best practices are followed.
2. Write descriptive PR descriptions, it makes it harder for me to review a PR if there is no description.
3. Make sure to submit PRs for each feature, do not submit a PR for a large number of files, again, it makes it harder for me to review.
